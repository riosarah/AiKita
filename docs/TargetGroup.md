## Target group
Target Group: Early Childhood Educators in Kindergarten
The target group for this project consists of early childhood educators working in kindergarten settings. These professionals are responsible for the development, education, and care of children aged 3 to 6
Early childhood educators play an important role in supporting childrenâ€™s learning through play-based and structured activities. They monitor developmental milestones, document everyday behaviour and facilitate an environment that encourages growth. 

  
**Professional Background and Experience:**
  
* Educational Qualifications: Early childhood educators hold certifications or degrees in early childhood education. Many have specialized training in pedagogy, child psychology or inclusive education.
* A growing number of schools no longer have enough qualified early childhood educators in house. They increasingly have to fall back on personnel without any background in early childhood education or any education at all. These employees are in desperate need of tools to help them with everyday planning of activities and handling child behaviour.
* Experience Level: Our target group consists of childhood educators who have just completed their training and are just starting their employment in kindergarten, as well as seasoned educators who already have a lot of experience.
* While our primary target demographic is early childhood educators, we want to make our tool available to parents and supporting staff in schools without a background in pedagogy.
  
**Demographics:**

* Age Range: Early childhood educators are typically adults aged 22-50, though this can vary. Training to become an early childhood educator in Austria typically starts very young at 14 yrs.
* Gender: The profession is predominantly female, although there is an increasing number of male educators entering the field.
  
**Work Environment:**

* Kindergarten Setting: They work in a variety of kindergarten environments, including public and private kindergarten schools. Besides public establishments the largest private holder is Caritas, which is a catholic charity organization.
* Work Hours: Most kindergarten schools start at 6:30 in the morning and are open until 17:00 in the afternoon. There are special work hours for institutions for shift workers, like medical personal, universities or manufacturing companies.
* Professional Goals and Challenges:
       Supporting Early Learning: Their primary goal is to provide a solid educational foundation in the early years, focusing on language development, motor skills, social interaction, and emotional growth.
* Challenges: Many educators face challenges such as managing classroom dynamics, addressing diverse learning needs, and working with limited resources or support. They may also struggle with finding effective strategies for engaging both children and parents in the learning process. The demands of the job have changed a lot in Austria in the recent years. With the growing unrest among early childhood educators and the necessity to have both parents working fulltime, the working conditions in childcare has been a rising topic in politics in the last few years.
  
**Technology and Professional Development:**

* Tech-Savvy: While some educators may be more familiar with traditional teaching methods, there is a growing shift toward incorporating technology into the classroom, whether through educational apps or online resources.
* Continuous Learning: They value professional development opportunities, including workshops, seminars, and courses, to stay current with the latest educational strategies and research on child development. Yearly training is required by law. Additional to first help courses, there is a wide array of trainings courses for various topics concerning early childhood education as well as courses to increase resilience for the demands of the job.
  
**Needs and Aspirations:**

* Pedagogical Tools and Resources: Early childhood educators seek tools and resources that can enhance learning outcomes for young children, such as interactive learning materials, engaging lesson plans, and effective behaviour management strategies. The most popular platforms provide learning materials and prepared activity plans.
* Work-Life Balance: Many in this group are also looking for ways to balance the emotional demands of their work with personal well-being, which may include seeking stress-relief techniques or community support.
The number of early childhood educators working in Austrian public or private kindergartens has been on the rise in the last decade. 
Similar trends can be observed in Germany and Switzerland.
