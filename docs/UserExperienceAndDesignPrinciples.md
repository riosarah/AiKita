# Design und User Experience (UX)

## UX/UI Design Principles and Accessibility

### User-Friendliness and Accessibility

_Note: Should the software be available to parents and supporting staff right from the start?_

Our software will be used by individuals with varying levels of digital literacy. To ensure usability for early childhood educators as well as parents and supporting staff with no pedagogical background, the user interface (UI) should include:

#### Simplicity and Intuitiveness

- The UI should be easily understandable, even without extensive training.
- Clear, self-explanatory icons and intuitive navigation.
- Context-sensitive help texts or tooltips explaining specific features.

#### Clarity and Structure

- A clean, clear layout with well-defined sections so users can quickly find what they need.
- Adequate white space to avoid clutter and improve visual clarity.

#### Customizable Settings

- Options to adjust font size, type, and contrast to enhance accessibility.
- Allow users to personalize the interface according to their individual needs.

#### Language

- Initially available in German to serve Austrian users first. Future plans include expansions to other languages.

#### Guided User Experience

- Step-by-step assistants or guided tutorials for onboarding new users.
- Instructions should be clearly and comprehensibly formulated.

#### Feedback and Confirmation

- Visual and/or auditory feedback to give immediate responses to user actions.
- Confirmation dialogs for specific events or critical tasks.

#### Consistency

- Consistent use of UI elements so users do not have to relearn the interface.
- Uniform colors, fonts, and layouts help maintain user-friendliness.

#### Accessibility for All User Groups

- Compatibility with assistive technologies, such as screen readers, to accommodate diverse user needs.

### Conclusion

Our software should be user-friendly and accessible, catering to both early childhood educators and parents or supporting staff who may have limited technical or pedagogical expertise.
