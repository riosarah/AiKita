# Monetization Strategy

## Revenue Models

### Subscriptions

1. **Monthly Subscriptions**  
    Users pay a monthly fee for access to software features.  
    **Example:** €10/month per user.
    
2. **Annual Subscriptions**  
    Users pay a discounted yearly fee compared to month-to-month billing.  
    **Example:** €100/year per user (approximately €8.33/month).
    

> **Note:**  
> This tiered model (monthly vs. annual) aligns with our sustainability approach by creating a predictable income stream.

### Advertising

1. **Banner Ads**  
    Integrate banner ads within the user interface, generating revenue through clicks or impressions.
    
2. **Sponsored Content**  
    Educational or related companies can sponsor content or activities.  
    **Example:** An educational publisher pays €500/month for a sponsorship contract.

## Pricing Strategy

1. **Introductory Price**  
    Offer a reduced introductory price to encourage early adoption.  
    **Example:** €5/month for the first three months.
    
2. **Discount Systems**
	**Volume Discounts**  
        Provide discounts for institutions (e.g., kindergartens) purchasing multiple licenses.  
        **Example:** 15% discount for 10 or more licenses.
    
3. **Freemium Model**  
    Present a free basic version of the software with limited features, which can be upgraded to paid tiers offering more comprehensive functionalities.

## Potential Revenue Sources

**Public and Private Kindergartens**  
	These institutions represent the core subscription market.

**Example:**  
	If 100 kindergartens with 5 users each pay €10/month:  
	`100 * 5 * €10/month = €5,000/month`

---

**Parents and Supporting Staff**  
	A secondary market for in-app purchases, premium content, or advertising.

**Example:**  
	If 50 parents purchase premium content at €10 per plan:  
	`50 * €10 = €500`

---

**Partnerships with Educational Companies**  
	Collaboration with publishers or educational product vendors can yield sponsorship fees or advertising revenue.

**Example:**  
	If 3 partner companies each pay €500/month:  
	`3 * €500/month = €1,500/month`
