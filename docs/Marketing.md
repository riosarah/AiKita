    Send targeted mailings to kindergartens and educational institutions that may not yet be aware of our offering.
    
- **Trade Fairs and Conferences**  
    Participate in industry events to showcase our software, network with potential partners, and increase visibility.
    
- **User Reviews and Testimonials**  
    Collect and share feedback after an initial pilot phase to build trust and credibility among prospective users.
    
- **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**  
    Optimize website content with relevant keywords to improve search engine rankings and boost organic discovery.
