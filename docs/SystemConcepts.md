## System Concepts 

### Detailed system concepts and techstack

  - **Local Client Application:**  
    A desktop application (built with Python and PyQt) for data entry,  
    local storage (using SQLite with SQLCipher for encryption), and  
    initial data anonymization.

  - **Cloud Backend:**  
    A Django-based API (leveraging Django REST Framework) that securely  
    receives anonymized data from the local client and stores it in  
    a robust database (PostgreSQL).

  - **Asynchronous Processing:**  
    A Celery Task Queue (using Redis or RabbitMQ) that schedules and  
    manages background tasks—most notably, triggering AI analysis.

  - **AI Analysis Module:**  
    A dedicated module that processes data using machine learning  
    libraries (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch) to generate insights  
    and vector representations.

  - **Vector Database:**  
    A specialized database (e.g., Milvus, Qdrant, or Weaviate) to store  
    high-dimensional vectors, enabling efficient similarity searches and  
    advanced analytics.

  - **Django Admin Interface:**  
    A built-in, customizable administrative dashboard for system monitoring,  
    data management, and operational control.

  ## Technology Stack
