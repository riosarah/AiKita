### Risk Mitigation Strategies 

- **Compliance and Security:**  
    Implement robust encryption, anonymization, and secure transmission practices.

- **Low-Bandwidth Communication and Error Handling:**
    Adopt data-sparse transmission techniques to accommodate limited bandwidth and provide clear local error messages for network disruptions, ensuring uninterrupted operations even under suboptimal connectivity.

- **User-Centric Design:**  
    Conduct iterative user testing and gather feedback early in the development process.

- **Modular Development:**  
    Use a modular, well-documented codebase to simplify future updates and scaling.

- **Contingency Planning:**  
    Develop clear maintenance and support plans, backed by subscription revenue to ensure sustainability.

- **Ongoing Maintenance:**   
	   Long-term support requires a commitment to regular updates, security patches, and customer support. 

- **Regular Security Audits:**  
    Scheduled reviews to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  
    Strict access controls for different user roles.

- **Data Minimization:**  
    Collect only the data essential for the intended analysis.

- **Backup & Recovery:**  
    Routine backups and a disaster recovery plan are in place to ensure data integrity and availability.
